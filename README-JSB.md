# The Glyph Miner version 0.2-alpha software package
This is the port of the original Glyph Miner to Python 3 made by
AsktheCode under the supervision of [Janusz
S. Bień](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5006-8183) (or vice versa ☺)) It
is available in the present repository
(https://github.com/jsbien/glyph-miner) and as a Docker image [not yet ready].


Glyph Miner is a software for rapidly extracting glyph occurrences from early
typeset prints. 

The original Python2 version is available in the repository
https://github.com/benedikt-budig/glyph-miner and as a Docker image

Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL)
